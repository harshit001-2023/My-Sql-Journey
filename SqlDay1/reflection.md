# Day 01 Reflection

Today I learned the four basic SQL commands for managing data.

- **`CREATE TABLE`** is used to define the structure of a new table, like setting up the columns in a spreadsheet.
- **`INSERT INTO`** is used to add new rows of data.
- **`SELECT *`** is a simple way to view all data from a table.
- **`SELECT ... WHERE`** is used to filter data, so I only see the specific rows and columns I need.
