# Day 07 Reflection

Today I learned about adding constraints to tables to protect data integrity.

-   The **`NOT NULL`** constraint ensures a column must always have a value.
-   The **`DEFAULT`** constraint provides a value for a column if one isn't specified during an `INSERT`.
-   The **`UNIQUE`** constraint ensures every value in a column is unique across all rows.
