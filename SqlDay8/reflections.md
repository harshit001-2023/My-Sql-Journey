# Day 08 Reflection

Today I learned about SQL `VIEWS`.

-   A **`VIEW`** is a virtual table based on the result of a `SELECT` query.
-   It's useful for simplifying complex queries, as I can save a complicated `JOIN` as a view and then query it easily.
-   Views don't store data themselves; they are a saved window into the real tables.
