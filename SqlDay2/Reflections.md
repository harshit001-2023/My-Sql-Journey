# Day 02 Reflection

Today I learned how to modify and delete data, and how to sort my results.

- **`UPDATE`** is used to change existing data in a specific row. The `WHERE` clause is extremely important to make sure I only change the correct row.
- **`DELETE`** is used to remove a row. The `WHERE` clause is also critical here to avoid deleting everything.
- **`ORDER BY`** is used with `SELECT` to sort the results, either in `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending) order.
