# Day 05 Reflection

Today I learned how to solve multi-step problems and add conditional logic to my queries.

-   A **Subquery** is a query nested inside another query. The inner query runs first, and its result is used by the outer query. The `IN` operator is often used with subqueries to check against a list of values.
-   The **`CASE`** statement adds `if-then-else` logic to a `SELECT` query. It's useful for creating categories or custom labels for data.
